# **ACE Certificate — Technical Interpretation**

## **1. A Complete, Deterministic Execution**  
An ACE Certificate represents the full, self‑contained output of a single ACE Engine execution for a specific customer, year, and scenario.  
It includes:

- the exact input  
- the domain profile  
- the soil parameters  
- the internal nitrogen and carbon state  
- the pool transitions  
- the final ledger state  
- the ACE version and method  

Nothing is missing.  
Any party with access to the ACE Engine can reproduce the result bit‑for‑bit.

---

## **2. A Cryptographically Anchored Ledger State**  
The certificate contains four SHA‑256 hash anchors binding:

- the input  
- the scenario  
- the calculation (the execution itself)  
- the method (ACE version + methodology)  

These anchors ensure:

- integrity  
- immutability  
- auditability  
- reproducibility  

This is not a blockchain.  
It is an **institutional ledger hash layer** designed for verifiable, deterministic state.

## **3. A Full Accounting of Biophysical Flows**  
The certificate contains the complete nitrogen and carbon bookkeeping for the year, including:

- nitrogen fixation  
- nitrogen losses  
- biomass uptake  
- pool changes  
- CO₂e storage  
- fossil emissions  
- net climate effect  

This constitutes the **ledger state** for the reporting period.

---

## **4. Proof That ACE Is Not ETL**  
The certificate demonstrates the ACE execution model:

- the input remains untouched  
- the state is produced deterministically  
- the engine does not mutate any database  
- the result is cryptographically anchored  
- the entire execution is certifiable  

ACE is a **ledger engine**, not a transformation pipeline.

---

## **5. A Portable, Verifiable, Future‑Proof Record**  
An ACE Certificate is designed to be:

- stored  
- transmitted  
- audited  
- re‑executed  
- independently verified  

It is a **self‑contained institutional record**, not a data dump.
